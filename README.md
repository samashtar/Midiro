## Interactive Piano with over 120 loaded samples

Play the piano with the keys on your keyboard. You can move up and down the octaves using the shortcuts ('V' and 'N'). The keys that you play notes with closely resemble the pattern of an actual piano, with the accidentals being diagonal to the proper white key inputs.

You are able to record, play and save your songs. Your songs will be saved in my rails database, to which you can play them back in the tab "My Songs."

You can find lyrics to your favorite songs using the "Find Lyrics" Tab.
